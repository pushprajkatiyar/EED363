### **Assignment 2**
1. Consider the given MNIST (Hand written digits)-dataset (Modified National Institute of Standards
and Technology dataset) which is in the Zip format (MNIST_Dataset.zip). Extract the corresponding CSV file into a folder such that it can be read into Jupyter-Notebook(.ipy). Extract
the features and target separately using pre-processing (if necessary) and split them into training
(70%, 80% or 90%) and testing (30%, 20% or 10%) sets.

(a) Apply KNN classifier and predict the labels for testing data and find the accuracy score for
the predictions. (Train your KNN with train data first and then fit it to predictions). Run the
loop for different K-values (ex. K=1 to 10) and determine the best K-value for which the
classifier gives better performance.

(b) Use Decision Tree Algorithm and predict the labels. Apply pruning methods to improve the
testing accuracy.

(c) Apply Random-Forest Classifier and predict the labels.

(d) Compare the performance of three classifiers and suggest the best one for given data set
