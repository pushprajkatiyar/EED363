### **Assignment 3**
1. Consider the MNIST (Hand written digits)-dataset (Modified National Institute of Standards and
Technology dataset) provided in the assignment 2. Extract the features and target separately using
pre-processing (if necessary) and split them into training (50%) and testing (50%) sets.

(a) Train the SVM classifier (Linearly Non-Separable) using the training data set and predict
the labels for testing data. Find the accuracy score for different C (Regularization or Penalty
Factor) values, 0.1,1 and 10. Observe the changes regarding performance and comment on
computational time.

(b) Use Gaussian Kernel (RBF) and predict the labels. With different C and gamma combinations (0.1, 1) and (1, 0.1), observe the effect on the classifier performance.

(c) Predict the labels by applying Polynomial Kernel and observe the performance changes for
different polynomial degree (d = 2, 4) values.

(d) Compare the performance of the three given classifiers, suggest the best among them for
the given data set with supportive comments and compare its performance with the Random
Forest classifier.

(e) Give detailed comments on the observed results of the different classifiers and how the parameters changes will affect the classifiers performances.
